## THE PROBLEM
The problem is that patients face challenges when it comes to physically visiting doctors and paying high costs. This can be time-consuming and expensive, and can make it difficult for patients to get the medical care they need.

## OUR SOLUTION 
Our online resource for consulting doctors aims to provide a convenient and accessible way for patients to connect with medical professionals from around the world. With our platform, patients can search through profiles of verified doctors and select the one that best meets their needs.
One of the main challenges patients face when seeking medical care is the lack of access to experienced doctors, especially those who specialize in specific areas of medicine. This can be especially difficult for people who live in remote areas or have mobility issues. Our platform aims to address this problem by making it easy for patients to consult with doctors from the comfort of their own homes.
Our platform offers a wide range of medical specialties, so patients can find a doctor who is an expert in their specific area of concern. We also provide detailed profiles for each doctor, including their education, training, experience, and areas of expertise. This helps patients make informed decisions about which doctor is the best fit for their needs.
In addition to searching for doctors by specialty, patients can also search for doctors by location. This is especially useful for patients who want to find a doctor who is convenient for them. Our platform also offers a booking system, so patients can schedule appointments with doctors at their convenience.
## BENEFITS
- Provide an option for telemedicine consultations, where patients can talk to doctors via video call or chat. This can be especially useful for people who live in remote areas or have mobility issues.
- Allow patients to rate and review their consultations with doctors, which can help other patients make informed decisions about which doctors to consult.
- Finally, ensure that the platform is secure and compliant with relevant laws and regulations (such as HIPAA in the US). This is crucial to ensure that patients' personal and medical information is protected.
- Check for slot availability of a doctor to reduce rush
- Consult with best doctor
- Cost saving and Time Saving
- Generate a disease and doctor history of patient

<details> <summary>NextJS Guide </summary>
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
